# devise-i18n

This is an attempt to have all the informal translations in one repo so that we can all more easily keep track with the upstream while using informal variant.

Add it to Gemfile and you're ready.

    gem 'devise-i18n', github: 'almirsarajcic/devise-i18n-informal', branch: 'informal'

Currently only Bosnian translation (bs.yml) has informal variant.
